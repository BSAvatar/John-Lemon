I worked by myself and I completed the following Major and Minor Mods to the game:

MAJOR MOD: You add a speed boost to the game. While the player is holding down a button, the character moves faster. However, this is only for a short time, and it needs to recharge after you use it. You create an icon on the screen to show whether the speed boost is active or not.

MINOR MOD: You make some changes to the behaviors of the existing enemies. For example, you add some randomness to the way Ghosts move.
